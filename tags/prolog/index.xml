      <description>The Game Chopsticks is a simple game of many variations played by children and college students. The variation I play is:
 two players start by each sticking both index fingers out to represent a count of one on each hand players alternate turns until someone loses by having a count of zero on both hands on a player&amp;rsquo;s turn, he must either:  use one of his hands with positive count $H1$ to tap one of the other player&amp;rsquo;s hands $H2$.</description>
