      <description>I first heard about gaming-as-a-service aka cloud gaming (not to be confused with games as a service aka GaaS) back in Wired magazine many years ago. The idea was new at the time and Wired talked about how the user experience was laggy and poor so I didn&amp;rsquo;t give it much thought. Fast forward to today and lots of the screenshots I see in game reviews look incredible. I&amp;rsquo;m curious to see for myself what the latest games look like at max settings, but like most people, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a computer that can play modern games nevermind play them at max settings.</description>
