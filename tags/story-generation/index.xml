      <description>TALE-SPIN TALE-SPIN1 is an AI program developed in 1977 by James R. Meehan. It works by using a knowledge base of actions to solve and modify goals. As actions are performed, they output text that form a story. In the words of the author:
 TALE-SPIN is a problem solver, top-down and goal-directed. Its output may be regarded as a trace through problem-solving procedures.
 Meehan rejected previous approaches with clean formulations that involved defining &amp;ldquo;one kind&amp;rdquo; of knowledge but sometimes resulted in bizarre stories.</description>
