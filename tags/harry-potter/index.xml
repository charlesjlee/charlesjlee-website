      <description>warning: plot spoilers below
I finally read the Harry Potter (HP) book series, which was very popular 15 years ago when I was teenager. The seven books went on to spawn an eight-part movie adaptation, video games, a prequel film series, a play, and theme parks. As a teenager, I avoided the books because they were popular and I was too cool for popular. It&amp;rsquo;s taken me some time, but I&amp;rsquo;m now mature enough for HP.</description>
