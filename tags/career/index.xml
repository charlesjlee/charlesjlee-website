      <description>A few years ago, I participated in my high school’s career day. I talked about my work at a blockchain start-up and preached the gospel of Bitcoin. It felt like a waste of everyone&amp;rsquo;s time because I don’t think the students understood what I was saying. How could they understand what it means to “improve API performance” when they don&amp;rsquo;t understand what an API is? I was certainly lost when I was in their shoes and attended my career day.</description>
