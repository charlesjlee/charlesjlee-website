## Introduction

This post is about my experience with the Uber man (UM) sleep schedule, the popularized and extreme polyphasic sleep schedule that achieves 2-3 hours of total daily sleep through periodic 20 minutes naps. The benefits are enticing: potentially (8-5)*7 = 21 more hours a week to enjoy and to get stuff done. With all that extra time, surely I'd be able to get through my to-do backlog! The requirements -- a flexible work schedule and a two-week adaptation period during which you are a brain-dead zombie -- are steep though, which is why I didn't gave UM any serious consideration until recently. UM success stories [1] would pop up a few times a year and the idea stayed in the back of my mind. Finally a change in my career from full-time, onsite to part-time, remote (with a 5 week break inbetween the transition) gave me an opportune window to adjust to and potentially stick with the schedule.

## The Plan

First things first, it was time to do some thinking and research. Why do I want to try the UM sleep schedule and how can I accomplish this?

Reasons I want to try UM:
o I hadn't been sleeping well and wanted to see if changing my sleep pattern would help. I would feel groggy when waking up and lethargic for most of the day, even after exercising and/or napping. I was originally interested in the Everyman schedule (3.5h core and 3 x 20 min naps) but Polyphasic Society [https://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/everyman/] recommends first attempting UM because, even if you fail to adapt to UM, adjusting to 20 minute naps will make subsequent attempts at any polyphasic schedule easier
o I wanted more time to do things. I had just finished the Organize stage of the Gettings Things Done method, in which you list out everything you want to do and determine the next physical step required. The mental lightness I felt after dumping all my recurring thoughts (and worries) onto paper was incredibly refreshing and I was eager to start tackling my list.
I realize that more time available does not always translate to more things done, and I was hoping to take advantage of the moments of mental clarity after waking from a well-timed nap to boost productivity
o Similarly, on rare occassions when I can afford to, I enjoy being awake during the late night and early morning hours. I find those hours to be the most peaceful and productives ones of the whole day and wanted to experience more of them

After evaluating my reaons for pursuing UM, I did some reading on what other people did and their experiences with the schedule. Apparently this UM thing is a scam... The majority of people fail to adapt from either lack of motivation or technique [2][3][4]. Those that were able to successfully adapt stopped because of social obligations [5][6] or perhaps fundamental human incompatability with the schedule[7].

Sounds like fun. Let's do this!

Using the recommendations on PolyphasicSociety.com [8], I settled on this plan for adapting to UM and decided to stick with the UM schedule for 6 weeks then evaluate whether I wanted to continue:
1) Stay up for 24h-48h to induce REM deprivation, i.e. exaptation
2) Nap every 2h for 3 days
3) Nap every 3h until the end of 6 weeks

I went on a lot about productivity above, but I anticipated that I would spend a lot of time just watching TV in a struggle to stay awake.

## Outcome

<graph with hours planned vs actual>

You can see that I didn't follow the schedule very well and never adapted to UM. This is because excuse_1, excuse_2, ..., excuse_99. The adjustment period was <i>rough</i>, and because I never adapted to the schedule, the entire 6  weeks was an adjustment period. I expected that my physical and mental facluties would be compromised by sleep deprivation during this experiment, but I was still surprised by the extent to which they were

Physically, I experienced headaches, malaise, intermittent naseau, weakness, wrist and heel pain that didn't heal until I broke routine and slept for 8 hours. Mentally, I experienced impaired short and long-term memory, mental fog, and complete 

In particular, there were three events that stood out as prime examples of sleep deprivation:
o Walking around ShopRite knowing that I needed to buy toppings to make pizza for dinner, but being unable to decide what to buy
o Watching Inception for the second time and not being emotionally moved or impressed or anything. I was mindblown the first time I saw the movie and I knew that something was wrong when I had no reaction the second time
o Sitting at the kitchen counter then seeing a large cockroach fly out from behind the fridge, fly into misc things next to the fridge, fall next to my hand, and then continue to drunkenly fly around and bump into things. It was bizzare seeing a cockroach, the unkillable insect, act so vulnerable and erratic. Maybe it was poisoned or otherwise dying? I was majorly spooked

For some reason, I naively assumed I would have enough time to get to everything on my To Do list. A moment's calculation reveals this to be ridiculous because it would have taken 527h=21.9 days to just watch my full anime/movie/TV backlog.

Ironically, not only did I accomplish very much work during those 6 weeks, I didn't do much TV-watching. Sleep deprivation completely drained me of any desire to do anything. It seemed like a waste to ruin shows I know I would have normally enjoyed by forcing myself to watch them

Ironically, I actually ended up sleeping more from ...yoyo

## Concluding thoughts

These 6 weeks were a generally unpleasant time. Even so, if given the choice, I would try UM again because it satisfised a long-standing curiosity and let me feel -- and not just know -- how devastating sleep deprivation can be. I also gave myself a reminder that increasing productivity is really about effective energy management and not time management. I have enough time to do the things I want; I don't have the habits, discipline, and energy to avoid squandering my free time.

At some point in the future, I will probably try that Everyman schedule I was originally eyeing, but not too soon.

I leave you with a quote from a J.G. Ballard short story -- about an experimental surgery to eliminate the ability to sleep -- that I coincidentally read during this time:

Continual consciousness is more than the brain can stand. Any signal repeated often enough eventually loses its meaning. Try saying the word "sleep" fify times. After a point the brain's self-awareness dulls. It's no longer able to grasp who or why it is, and it rides adrift
