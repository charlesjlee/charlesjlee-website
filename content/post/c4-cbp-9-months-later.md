Back in March 2017, I [posted about](http://charlesjlee.com/post/c4-certified-bitcoin-professional/) passing the Certified Bitcoin Professional (CBP) exam by C4. I did this partly out of curiosity and partly hoping it would help in a job search for crypto roles. My curiosity was satisfied, my wallet \$73 lighter, and no employers seemed to care. Not surprisingly, what did help during my job search were my understanding of Bitcoin and my crypto sideprojects.

There is a more technical [CBX (Certified Bitcoin Expert)](https://cryptoconsortium.org/certifications/CBX) exam intended for developers that looks promising: it covers the API and scripting. But given my experience with the usefulness of CBP and the lack of updates in the C4 organization, I would not bother. Since I took the exam 9 months, the only thing that has changed is the exam price \$73 --> \$135. Notably, the last [blog post](http://blog.cryptoconsortium.org
) was on June 23, 2016 and the CBX exam has been "coming soon" since CBP was launched back in 2014.

Verdict: Pass on C4 certification
