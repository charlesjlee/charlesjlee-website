I attended the OrigamiUSA convention this year from June 26-27. The convention is usually held on a college campus, but this year, instead of canceling it, OUSA decide to reduce the number of events and host it on Zoom. I attended an in-person convention a few years and actually preferred this year's online one:
 - I could participate from my sofa instead of commuting 1.5+ hours each way and day
 - I had all my tools and supplies readily available
 - I actually got to attend the classes I wanted. Classes taught by famous artists, e.g. Robert J. Lang, are in high demand and it's normally difficult to secure a spot. When I went to the in-person convention, I wasn't able to attend most of the classes that I (and everyone else) wanted

This is the list of events this year, followed by my foldings of all the models:
