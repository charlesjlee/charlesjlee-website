## Introduction
It's been almost two and a half years since I've updated this website. While I was away, GitHub Actions was released and Hugo jumped from version 0.31 to 0.70! My old Hugo code no longer builds and instead of updating incrementally, I decided it was easier to just rebuild from scratch with the latest version. At the same time, I would update the theme[<sup>1</sup>][1] I use and integrate GitHub Actions to replace the now-unnecessary deployment script [<sup>2</sup>][2][<sup>3</sup>][3].

I used the Hugo Quick Start guide[<sup>4</sup>][4] for the initial setup and then some helpful articles[<sup>5</sup>][5][<sup>6</sup>][6][<sup>7</sup>][7] for the GitHub Actions setup. I did, however, stumble a few times because some steps or details were missing, so I wrote this step-by-step, end-to-end guide that is a compilation of the aforementioned resources.

## Overview and Plan
1. [Create and configure GitHub repo](#1-create-and-configure-github-repo)
2. [Develop on repo locally](#2-develop-on-repo-locally)
3. [Use GitHub Actions to deploy](#3-use-github-actions-to-deploy)

We're going to store our code on the **master** branch and the generated site on the **gh-pages** branch. If you don't already have Hugo installed[<sup>8</sup>][8], Git installed, and your GitHub SSH account key[<sup>9</sup>][9] configured, you should take care of that before proceeding.

The final repo is available at https://github.com/charlesjlee/hugo-github-pages-actions-demo

## 1) Create and configure GitHub repo
Navigate to **+**  in the upper right-hand to find **New repository**, fill out the form, and click **Create repository**.
{{<fluid_lightbox_imgs
    "pure-u-1-1|/img/20200517-github-create-repo.png|Create GitHub repo"
>}}

Click **Branch: master â–¾** on the left side, type **gh-pages** into the text field, and click **Create branch: gh-pages from 'master'** to create the branch.
{{<fluid_lightbox_imgs
    "pure-u-1-1|/img/20200517-github-create-branch.png|Create gh-pages branch"
>}}

Since we named our branch **gh-pages**, GitHub Pages automatically designated this branch as our **Source**, so we don't need to set this ourselves. You can confirm this by navigating to **âš™ Settings** and then scrolling all the way to down to the **GitHub Pages** section. This also means that our site is now live at **https://{user}.github.io/{repo}/**, where **{user}** and **{repo}** are replaced with your GitHub username and repo name. If you navigate there now, the only thing you'll see is the contents of **README.md** like below because we just branched **gh-pages** from an empty **master**.

{{<fluid_lightbox_imgs
    "pure-u-1-1|/img/20200517-github-branch-initial.png|Initial gh-pages site"
>}}

## 2) Develop on repo locally
Our repo is now ready to use. We're going to clone **master** locally so we can setup and test our site.

If you're not on the **master** branch, use the **Branch** dropdown on the left side to switch to the **master** branch. Click the green **Clone or download** button on the right side, then click the clipboard ðŸ“‹ icon to copy the path.

{{<fluid_lightbox_imgs
    "pure-u-1-1|/img/20200517-github-master-clone.png|Clone master"
>}}

Now open a shell (e.g. PowerShell, bash) in the directory where you want to work and clone **master**. In the example below, I'm using PowerShell and **C:\Hugo** as my directory. The path for **git clone** should be in your clipboard from the previous step.

```PowerShell
PS C:\Hugo> git clone git@github.com:charlesjlee/hugo-github-pages-actions-demo.git
Cloning into 'hugo-github-pages-actions-demo'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (4/4), done.
```

Next, we'll use **hugo new site** to create a new site. This command will create the folders and files that Hugo needs to function. Since our project directory already exists, we have to pass the **--force** and make sure that the site name matches the repo name.
```PowerShell
PS C:\Hugo> hugo new site hugo-github-pages-actions-demo --force
Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in C:\Hugo\hugo-github-pages-actions-demo.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/ or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>\<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.
```

Then we'll move into our repo and download the **ananke** theme.
```PowerShell
PS C:\Hugo> cd hugo-github-pages-actions-demo
PS C:\Hugo\hugo-github-pages-actions-demo> git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
Cloning into 'C:/Hugo/hugo-github-pages-actions-demo/themes/ananke'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 23, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (23/23), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (22/22), done.
remote: Total 1636 (delta 6), reused 8 (delta 1), pack-reused 1613
Receiving objects: 100% (1636/1636), 4.23 MiB | 13.50 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (897/897), done.
```

To configure our site to use the newly downloaded theme, we need to add the line **theme = "ananke"** to our site's configuration file **config.toml**. You can do this by opening **config.toml** in a text editor, adding the line, and saving the file. We also need to update **baseURL** and enable **relativeURLs**. When you're done, **config.toml** should look like this:
```toml
baseURL = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My New Hugo Site"
theme = "ananke"
relativeURLs = true
```

We now have the minimum we need to create a barebones website. You can see the current state of the site by running **hugo server -D** and then going to **http://localhost:1313/** in your browser. We'll use the **-D** flag momentarily.
```PowerShell
PS C:\Hugo\hugo-github-pages-actions-demo> hugo server -D

```

Your site will look like this: no content and title text still set to the default.
{{<fluid_lightbox_imgs
    "pure-u-1-1|/img/20200517-barebones.png|Barebones site"
>}}

Notice above that **hugo server -D** said it was "watching for changes". This allows us to add/update/modify files and watch the site change in real-time. With **hugo server -D** still running in your shell, open **config.toml** and change the value of **title**. You should see this change reflected immediately in the site.

Let's a create a new post using **hugo new** in a separate shell. We should see this post appear immediately when we revisit the site. **hugo new** is just a convenience function for creating stubs for posts; you can also create these by hand. If you don't see your post appear on your site, it's probably because new posts are created with **draft: true** and you forgot to run **hugo new** with the **-D** flag.
```PowerShell
PS C:\Hugo\hugo-github-pages-actions-demo> hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
C:\Hugo\hugo-github-pages-actions-demo\content\posts\my-first-post.md created
```

This is a good time to commit our code
```PowerShell
PS C:\Hugo\hugo-github-pages-actions-demo> git status

Now let's talk about deployment. Executing **hugo** will build your site and put it into a new directory named **public**. You could then just "simply" commit the contents of **public** to the **gh-pages** branch. Actually doing this requires a couple of different steps so people back in the day scripted this process[<sup>2</sup>][2][<sup>3</sup>][3] and even deployed their script, e.g. on Netlify, so it ran automatically on a commit to **master**. GitHub Actions takes care of both of these steps (watching for a commit to **master**, building the site and committing to **gh-pages**) and staying within the GitHub ecosystem means our setup will be simpler than if we used a third-party service or manually ran a script.

## 3) Use GitHub Actions to deploy
We enable GitHub Actions by creating a file in the **.github/workflows** directory. First though, we'll need to add a "secret" to our repo that is proof that the holder is authorized to make changes to the repo. We can do this by creating a "deploy key", which is an SSH key similar to our "account key" but only grants access to a single repo. 

Generate an RSA (private, public) key-pair and save it to the files (**master**, **master.pub**). We won't be committing these files, so you can do this in any directory.
```PowerShell
PS C:\Hugo> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "$(git config user.email)" -f master -N '""'
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in master.
Your public key has been saved in master.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:iRd5eMCgndRLWlQuUtD4Z5ep/pmneBGxiK+GHiKKOA4 charleslee592@gmail.com
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|      +O+..      |
|     +.o*=  .    |
|    . +==o+. =   |
|      .o+*+ *    |
|      . S+ o .   |
|       .  o .    |
|E . . .. o   .   |
|=. . ...o ...o.  |
|=o   ...  .o=o   |
+----[SHA256]-----+ 
```

Open your repo in GitHub and navigate to **âš™ Settings** --> **Secrets** --> **New secret**. **Name** should be **ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY** and **Value** should be the contents of the file named **master**.
{{<fluid_lightbox_imgs
    "pure-u-1-1|/img/20200517-github-secrets.png|Creating a new secret"
>}}

Then navigate to **âš™ Settings** --> **Deploy keys** --> **Add deploy key**. **Title** should be **ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY**, **Key** should be the contents of the file named **master.pub**, and **Allow write access** should be checked.
{{<fluid_lightbox_imgs
    "pure-u-1-1|/img/20200517-github-deploy-keys.png|Creating a deploy key"
>}}

After the above two steps are done, you should delete **master** and **master.pub**. We won't need them anymore and they're dangerous to leave sitting around because someone who gets a hold of the private key **master** might be able to deploy to your repo.

Next, we create the workflow directory and file. I used **ni** to create the file but you might need **touch**. We're calling the file **deploy.yml** but the YML file can be named anything.
```PowerShell
PS C:\Hugo\hugo-github-pages-actions-demo> mkdir .github/workflows
PS C:\Hugo\hugo-github-pages-actions-demo> ni .github/workflows/deploy.yml
```

Open **deploy.yml** in a text editor, paste in the below, and save. There are a couple things you'll need to change, but first let's unpack this by describing what's going on in English:

"When a *push* is made to this branch, i.e. *master*, execute a job named *deploy* inside of a container running the *ubuntu-18.04* OS. This job is composed of five ordered *steps*: (1) checking out the code in master, (2) checking out the code for our themes, (3) setting up Hugo to run in the next step, (4) running *hugo* to build our site, (5) deploying the contents of *./public* into *gh-pages*"

```yaml
name: CI
on: push
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - name: Git checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Update theme
        run: git submodule update --init --recursive

      - name: Setup hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: "0.70.0"

      - name: Build
        # run: hugo --minify
        run: hugo

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          deploy_key: ${{secrets.ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY}}

          publish_dir: ./public

          user_email: charleslee592@gmail.com
          publish_branch: gh-pages
          # cname: ï»¿www.charlesjlee.com
```

Required Changes
{{<pure_table
    "Field Name|Valid Value"
    "external_repository|this should be {username}/{repo_name}"
    "user_name|this can be anything, but it would make sense to match what you use when committing to master"
    "user_email|ditto"
>}}

Optional Changes
{{<pure_table
    "Description|Comment"
    "hugo-version|I use 0.70.0. You should use whichever version of hugo you have running locally to avoid situations where local vs remote behavior don't match"
    "hugo --minify|this will minify the HTML output generated by 'hugo' by removing comments and whitespace. This may lead to performance improvements, but will make the HTML output difficult to read and debug"
    "cname|set this if you are using a custom domain. see this post for details https://www.charlesjlee.com/post/20200516-github-pages-dns/"

Let's commit this file and see our workflow in action.

## The End
You're done! You now have a setup that makes it easy to both test changes locally and deploy remotely. For reference, this repo contains all the changes up to this point and is ready to fork and use:
https://github.com/charlesjlee/hugo-github-pages-actions-demo

The site is looking a bit bare though. Some things you can explore further:
- the post we made earlier, **my-first-post.md**, doesn't appear on our site because it has the **draft** flag enabled. Delete that flag to enable the post
- make more posts!
- explore and try out different themes[<sup>10</sup>][10]. It's even possible to layer multiple themes
- learn about Hugo Templating[<sup>11</sup>][11] and how to customize aka override themes
- buy and configure a custom domain[<sup>12</sup>][12]. I have a post on configuring the DNS[<sup>13</sup>][13]
