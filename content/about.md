This place is where I post projects I have worked and will work on, my musings on programming and life, my thoughts and feelings, and other universal truths. My schooling and trade are in operations research and application/database development, respectively. At the moment, I'm exploring deep learning and block chain.

You can reach me at charleslee592<span style="display:none">foo</span>@gmail.com. My resume is in the sidebar.
